# Array

An array is Data Structure (container) that can be used to store multiple value of same datatype in a single variable.

- Arrays are stored in contagious memory [consecutive memory locations].
- The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning from 0.
- The size of the array cannot be altered (once initialized). However, an array reference can be made to point to another array.
