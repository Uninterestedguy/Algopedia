# Linked List

 A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Representation of Linked Lists

 A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head of the linked list. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL.

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:

- A Data Item (we can store integer, strings, or any type of data).
- Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or an address of another node

Application of Linked List:

- Implement in Stack and Queue
- GPS Navigation
- Music Playlist
